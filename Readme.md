This is my First project build using React.
The Buiding process is given bellow:-
1)Here I have used Create-react-app to build the basic structure.
2) The features of this app is very simple-
   a)You can type any name of your task
   b)You can type any description of your task
   c)You can delete created task by clicking the Delete button
   d) Even if you close the window and revisit the website or reload the page the
      taks won't be deleted.
3) This app has 5 COMPONENTS -
    a)A Header component-this is the nav bar
    b)Addtodo component- This is the form that is used to add tasks
    c)Todos component- This is where all your tasks will be shown
    d)TodoItem component - This is the each of your individual tasks
    e)Footer component - This is the footer at the end of the webpage
4) I have used localstorage to save the tasks.
5) Here I have used useEffect & useState Hooks
